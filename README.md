# 👋 Hi, I'm Matteo Mekhail — Builder, Developer

I'm a software engineer and founder based in Sydney.  
I build products, automate everything I can

Over the years, I've been:
- Writing code since I was 14, yeah i know it may look like a long time, but minecraft mods in java were fun to write!
- Creating systems that make life easier
- Developing Full-Stack Application, that can vary from a basic website to a SaaS that i wish existed before when i needed them

---

## 🚀 What I’m Building

- **StageTwo POS** — point-of-sale and hospitality software made with Laravel + React  
- **PokeBench** -- is a fun benchmark to measure how good are AI models are in recognizing images, they not that great and you'd be surprised!
